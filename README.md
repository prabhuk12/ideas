Every file here is a html so use the htmlpreview github to get it rendered for you. For instance the MCP presentation would be https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/prabhuk12/ideas/blob/main/mcp_presentation.html. To do this first click on the presentation you are looking for and then prepend it with

https://htmlpreview.github.io/?

Enjoy !!
